Hi there! I'm Jack.

I'm a final year PhD student with the Australian Centre for Robotics at the University of Sydney. At the moment I am a Fulbright Future Scholar at Carnegie Mellon University's Computational Imaging Lab.

I'm interested in computational imaging, computer vision, robotic perception and scene representation. My work is focussed on building new sensors, algorithms and representations to help systems operate in complex environments, e.g. underwater and space, where they are faced with reflection, transparency and other visual phenomena.
